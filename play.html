        <p><h4 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h4> <p class="speech">What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
            walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
            and visit the neighbors?</p>
        </p>

        <p><h4 class="POPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h4> <p class="speech">He loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
            or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
            when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby--give him
            an extra measure of oats to-day!</p>
        </p>
        <p><h4 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h4> <p class="speech">Yes, ma'am.</p>

        <p><h4 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h4> <p class="speech">Yes, ma'am.</p> <p class="direction">[_He goes out, centre._</p></p>
        <p><h4 class="POPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h4> <p class="direction">[_Gazing at the photograph._]</p> <p class="speech">You shall see, Nikolai, how I
            can love and forgive! My love will die only with me--when my poor heart
            stops beating.</p> <p class="direction">[_She smiles through her tears._]</p> <p class="speech">And aren't you ashamed?
            I have been a good, true wife; I have imprisoned myself and I shall
            remain true until death, and you--you--you're not ashamed of yourself,
            my dear monster! You quarrelled with me, left me alone for weeks----</p>
